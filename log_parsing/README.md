0x03. Log Parsing

Description

This project is about writing a Python script that reads stdin line by line and computes specific metrics:

Total file size
Number of occurrences for each status code (200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405, and 500)
The script prints the statistics every 10 lines and upon receiving a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C).
